Casey is still enjoying his vacation till later next week. Although originally we did not plan on a patch this week, I decided to release a small update focusing on improvements to the daily climbs! 

[h1]Daily Climb Changes[/h1]
The Daily Climb has been heavily altered based on your feedback!

There are now only 3 mods total for each day instead of 4. Additionally, the seed that chooses the mods will now only very rarely pick the same mod two days in a row (and never more than two in a row). This means you will not get stuck facing down the same modifiers day after day. 

Additionally, many of the mods were altered or reworked to focus more on creating interesting situations instead of being straight difficulty raisers. 

Finally, the Daily now has it's own leaderboard that can be seen on the Daily screen itself. 

The Daily Climb is still a work in progress, so please continue to provide feedback and suggestions, but these changes should make the overall daily experience more enjoyable to play.
