Hey everyone,

I just got back from vacation. I heard there was a surprise patch last week? I just found out, what a surprise!

Fortunately, our company is 2 people so there's a patch this week, too.
Many have asked us if we will be at GDC this year. We will NOT be attending this year, sorry. Good news, we'll be working on the game instead!

[b]Patch Notes[/b]

[h1]Content[/h1]

[*]Daily Mod: Hoarder: Whenever you obtain a card, two extra copies are also obtained. Cards can't be removed at Shops.

[*]Champ has less randomness in his AI after enraging. Will use Metallicize less.
[*]Exploder enemy rework. They now explode in 3 turns, deals more damage, and has less HP.
[*]Hexaghost slightly nerfed on Ascension 4+. (Deals less damage).
[*]Rage card gets a buff, cost 1 -> 0. Block 4 -> 3.
[*]Shovel relic now uses reward screen so that you can skip the relic if you do not want it.
[*]Underhanded Strike card rework: Cost 2: Deal 8 damage. If you have discarded a card this turn, gain 2 Energy.

[list]
[*]Fixed crash if twitchconfig was empty or invalid.
[*]Increased timeout on dailies time lookup.
[*]Moved the twitch button so it isn't covering other buttons.
[*]Relics and Potions in the shop now correctly set their prices when restocked with the Courier.
