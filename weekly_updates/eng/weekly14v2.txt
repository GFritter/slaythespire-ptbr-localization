Patch 14 is here!

[h1]Daily Climb[/h1]
Once a day, a difficult challenge is created by combining several rule bending modifiers. The same seed is utilized by everyone so the Daily Climb allows players to see how well they stack up with the same choices.
This a work in progress and modifiers will be added and tweaked, randomization will be reduced, and leaderboards will eventually be added as well.
